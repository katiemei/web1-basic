<div class="column2of2">

<p>Born into the restaurant business he knew he wanted a different life. Being smart, dedicated
to his studies, and having the precise mind of an engineer he set his sights on college and a career.</p>

<p>Lovingly raised and fatherless at a tender age, Wing knew the value of family and married a smart, 
determined young woman. Together they built and successful family.</p>

<p>Promoted and sent overseas, he rose to the top of his profession while learning about the world
around him, never forgetting where he came from.</p>

<p>Retired, active, father, grandfather, and engineer. These are the roles that keep Wing busy and ever 
present in our lives. Help us celebrate the full tapestry that is Wing's life!</p>
